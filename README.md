# Code-Compressor-Decompressor
This project implements dictionary-based lossless code compression/decompression in Java. This methodology is used in embedded systems to optimize memory usage.

The compressor leverages repetition to encode instructions using the dictionary, Run-Length Encoding, and bitmasks/mismatches, and automatically chooses the most favorable compression method allowing for optimal code-size reduction throughout the instruction set.
