# Code-Compressor-Decompressor
Dictionary-based lossless code compression/decompression in Java.

This compressor leverages repetition to encode instructions using the dictionary, Run-Length Encoding, and bitmasks/mismatches.

The compressor automatically chooses the most favorable compression method, allowing for the best code-size reduction throughout the instruction set.
